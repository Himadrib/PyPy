Haiving problem while removing dublicate or want to seperate lines with comma or anything is possible with this small script.
Just make a text file containing list of lines you want to search for dublicates in column. 
save the text file and put the name of the file in the script and run.
you will get unique line with comma after every sentence and in row.
